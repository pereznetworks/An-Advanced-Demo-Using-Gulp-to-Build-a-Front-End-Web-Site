# Summary:

    Using Gulp to Build a Front-End Site

    In this project you’ll be provided a website with
     HTML, SCSS, JPEGs, PNGs and JavaScript files.

    You’ll be required to set up a Gulp build process to
     prepare the website for deployment.

    The build process must fulfill the following criteria:

      Concatenate and minify the JavaScript files.
      Compile SCSS into CSS in a concatenated and minified file.
      Generate JavaScript and CSS source maps.

      All output for the build process should be in a dist folder
       for distribution or deployment.
